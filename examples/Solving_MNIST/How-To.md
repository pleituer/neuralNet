# Solving_MNIST

## How to use

It's simple, to run the file, do
```
~$ python3 MNISTSolved.py
```

**NOTE: This example makes uses of the [LeNet model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20LeNet%20refers%20to,in%20large%2Dscale%20image%20processing.)**

**And FYI, training this on an i7/r7 processor takes around 20 minutes, so run it at your own risks**
