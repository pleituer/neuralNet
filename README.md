# neuralNet

This is an attempt to recreate neural networks by using built-in modules and numpy, no pytorch, no tensorflow

Implemented
- Dense Layer
- Activations (tanh, sigmoid, ReLu, softmax)
- GRUs (a simplistic one with one internal weight and one internal activation function, tanh)
- LSTM (still in progress of debugging)

#### Note: This project is started and heavily influenced by a video by the YouTube channel The Independent Code, [Neural Network from Scratch | Mathematics & Python Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pauPCy_s0Ok). Thus, part of the code will be the same.
